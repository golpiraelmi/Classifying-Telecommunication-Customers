A telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. We will build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case. 

We use demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns. 

The target field, called __custcat__, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows:
  1- Basic Service
  2- E-Service
  3- Plus Service
  4- Total Service

Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
